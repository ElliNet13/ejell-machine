## Story

The original idea came on 04/07/2021. It was inspired by Pyll Machine made by Waity5. It is currently still under progress, you might get a preview when joining the Discord server for Jell Machine.

## Features

It includes all features of Mystic Mod, but many other suggestions from the Mystic Mod Discord server. They include:

* New cells like Redirector
* Box filling
* Generation counter
<!-- * Very important: loading from and saving into files -->
<!-- * Infinite grid -->
<!-- * Open multiple levels at once -->
* Multiplayer support
* Modding support (yes you can mod a mod)

The main goal is to improve user experience, so new cells might take some time to get added.
